# CA-1 :
 Part 1: Creating a model to estimate path loss and shadowing for a given number of UEs and a BS. Additionally, the aim is to calculate the probability of outage and the extent of coverage in a narrowband channel.

Part 2: Simulating a wireless channel with multiple paths within a specific bandwidth, while optionally taking into account the Doppler effect.

# CA-2 :
Part 1: Simulating a narrowband wireless system, observing its performance using various modulations. Additionally, a diversity approach is applied to improve the systemâ€™s performance.

Part 2: Assuming a frequency selective channel and aiming to transmit a message using OFDM. The OFDM system parameters are calculated based on the channel parameters. The system is then implemented with different equalizers: waterfilling approach, space diversity, zero-forcing and MMSE. We also assume clipping due to amplifier presence.
